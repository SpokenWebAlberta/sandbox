**The SpokenWeb Research Network is hosting the 2023 SpokenWeb Research Symposium on the theme of "Reverb: Echo-Locations of Sound and Space" at the University of Alberta, in Edmonton, Canada from May 1-3, 2023.** As our conference theme, "reverb" invites participants reflect on how sound is situated, transformed, and territorialized through physical, cultural, historical, and political spaces. The conference features panel presentations, author readings, live performance, sound exhibits, and artist talks. Highlights include keynote presentations by Spy Dénommé-Welch and Gascia Ouzounian; a plenary performance of “From the Prairies to the Pacific Rim” by poet-artists Erica Hiroko Isomura, Emily Riddle, and Sacha Ouellet; and Inside the Bag, the launch of the Canadian Literature Centre archives, featuring a roundtable discussion with poets, archivists, and curators.

**After the Symposium, SpokenWeb Network members are invited to take part in the SpokenWeb Institute from May 4-5**, a series of workshops and training activities designed in collaboration with UAlberta's Sound Studies Institute.

**Join us for a conversation with author Kit Dobson on methodologies of listening** and the ways they might open up alternative forms for scholars. Kit's most recent book, <i>Field Notes on Listening</i>, describes practices of radical listening in place that respond to a world of climate change, pandemic, Indigenous-Settler relations, and the stories and histories of family.

**Kit Dobson lives and works in Calgary / Treaty 7 territory in southern Alberta.** His previous books include <i>Malled: Deciphering Shopping in Canada</i> and he is a professor in the Department of English at the University of Calgary. He grew up in many places across Canada, but returned again and again to the landscapes of northern Alberta where his family members settled--and that continue to animate his thinking.

Co-Sponsored by the Canadian Literature Centre at the University of Alberta and SpokenWeb.

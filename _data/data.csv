She was one of the founding members of Poets' Conference and Poets' Union in Britain, and was an influential figure in the formation of public reading series in England. She is the author of three books of poetry, all of which were well received: Flying (Workshop Press), Monkey's Wedding (Cape), and the recent Christmas in Africa (J.J.

Some of the critical praise for Christmas in Africa: ""One is grateful to a poet who can recover for the modern reader the authentic and mythopoetic voice"" -- Rosemary Sullivan, CVII. ""She sings and curses, applauds and deplores the conditions of humanity in these wonderfully moving poems, which include memories of Africa, personal and symbolic extensions of themes in conteporary science-fiction writing, and finally, her own intesely human reactions to everyday things . . .
